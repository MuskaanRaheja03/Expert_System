The term "expert system" can refer to a computer program that is capable of decision making and can
be used for diagnostics and classification. Furthermore, since the underlying knowledge used by the
system is typically provided by a human expert, a rudimentary expert system is a relatively simple
project. For this assignment, you will practice with branching control structures by creating your own
expert system that uses user input to "guess" film titles. Please note that, if your submission cannot
identify the movie in 7 guesses or less, then your questions are poorly constructed and will be penalized.
As a clarifying example, the partial transcript such an expert system might follow for the subgenre of
"Animated Christmas Special" could be as follows (with user input in red):
Was the film based on a story by Dr. Seuss? no
Does the film use stop-motion animation? yes
"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (1964)" is the film title.
In order to complete this task, you will need to:
• choose two movie "subgenres" from http://www.filmsite.org/subgenres2.html1
• choose at least ten movies for each of your two subgenres (i.e., at least twenty movies total)
• devise a set of "yes-or-no" questions to identify movies (without directly referencing titles)2
• create a flowchart of what questions you intend to ask and in what order3
Your submission for this assignment:
• must first ask the user if they require instructions (and provide some if the answer is "yes")
• must then ask the user which of the two subgenre expert systems they would like to consult
• must then ask the user "yes-or-no" questions (without asking questions unneccessarily)
• must include (as comments) a list of distinguishing elements for each of your selected movies4
• can assume that the user will always enter valid input when prompted
